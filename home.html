		<p><em>India</em> is a grand country. It is the seventh largest country in the world and the second most populated country in the world. Many see India as a sub-continent rather than a country. There exist in different parts of India, different cultures, languages, manners as well as different historical backgrounds and influences of the same historical events. The official name for the country is <strong>Republic of India</strong>. The Indians call their country <strong>INDIA</strong>.<br>
		There are also two other names for India less known outside India namely <strong><em>BHARAT</em></strong>and <strong><em>HINDUSTAN</em></strong>.<br><br>
